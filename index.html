    <p> Below are random neutral coalescent genealogies for a sample of nine
    individuals with Î¸ = 10. Some trees may have branches that overlap (still
    need to work out this bug), so you may need to refresh a few times. Hover
    over alleles to trace
    ancestry. <a href="https://github.com/vsbuffalo/coaljs">Source code
